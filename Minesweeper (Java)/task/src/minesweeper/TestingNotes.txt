 TO DO:

1)[Done] Opening all safe cells win the game
    NOTE: marking all cells successfully ends game at the moment (8/4/2025)
2) Topics I want to try and implement:
  - Logging
  - Exceptions (log these)
3) [Done] If the player explores a mine, print the field in its current state,
   with mines shown as X symbols. After that, output the message:
   You stepped on a mine and failed!.
   - Implement a gameOver method which prints the current board with mines marked as X's
4) [Done, not tested] Generate mines like in the original game: the first cell explored with the free command cannot be a mine;
   it should always be empty. You can achieve this in many ways â€“ it's up to you.




   Checked soln on 8/10: was not correct
   - 100% has something to do with the first free being on a bomb
